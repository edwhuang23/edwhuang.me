This is my personal website that includes everything from my resume to personal projects!

## Making Changes

Textual changes such as adding experiences or making changes to a project description are made through the `config` folder only.

Website design changes such as adding a blog are made through the `components` folder and `index.html`.

## Run local website 

`bundle exec jekyll serve`
